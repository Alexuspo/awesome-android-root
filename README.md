## What is Android Root?

Android rooting is the process of gaining privileged control (known as root access) over various Android subsystems. Rooting allows overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices, resulting in the ability to alter or replace system applications and settings, run specialized apps that require administrator-level permissions, or perform other operations that are otherwise inaccessible to a normal Android user.

## Magisk

[Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) is the most popular and powerful tool for Android power users, providing root access, boot scripts, and a module system for customizing Android devices systemless-ly. It's actively maintained and regularly updated.

[Download Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)

## KernelSU

[KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) is a kernel-based root solution for Android devices. It provides a root method that works by modifying the kernel, offering an alternative to Magisk for some devices and use cases. KernelSU is gaining popularity, especially on newer devices.

## LSPosed
[LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) is an open-source framework designed to replace the traditional Xposed Framework, allowing users to install and use Xposed/LSPosed modules on their Android devices.
