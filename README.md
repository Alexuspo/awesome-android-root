## Understanding Root
Android rooting is the process of gaining privileged control (known as root access) over various Android subsystems. Rooting allows overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices, resulting in the ability to alter or replace system applications and settings, run specialized apps that require administrator-level permissions, or perform other operations that are otherwise inaccessible to a normal Android user.

## Decision Making
### Should I root
Now to the main question. Should i root?
First, let's view disadvantages then advantages.

#### Advantages
- You can grant apps, Su and they'll do a great job for you.
- You can tweak kernel= great performance for games.
- You can ban ads from your device completely.
- You can uninstall unnecessary apps, i.e., system apps.
- You can perform much more super enjoying tasks, they all can't be listed here.

#### Disadvantages
- As a root user, if you ever mess up, it's all your responsibility to fix it.
- Personally i never faced it, even though i messed up the device to the worst condition. People usually say your device may hard brick.
- Banking apps won't work. Recently, some apps are detecting root even with Magisk (there are workarounds for most of them).
- Rooting process if messed, Although it can be fixed, it can be tough for beginners.

#### Community Debate
- Here is the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1c69h3q/is_rooting_still_something_you_would_do_in_2024/) Debating if its worth it rooting in 2024 (but in my opinion its worth every penny).

## Root Solutions
### How to root
It really depends upon your device; it's recommended to check the XDA forum for your device, which usually has a good guide for your devices. Another option is telegram groups for your devices, as they have specific communities related to your device.
Generally, the following steps are common:
- Unlock the boot loader.
- Get a custom recovery installed.
- Flash your preferred method of rooting solutions from below.
- Enjoy the ultimate power of a rooted device.
