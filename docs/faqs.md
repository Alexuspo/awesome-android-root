# Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### What is rooting?
Rooting is the process of gaining privileged control (root access) over the Android operating system. This allows you to modify system files, install custom ROMs, and run apps that require administrative permissions.

#### Why would I want to root my device?
Rooting allows you to:
- Remove pre-installed bloatware
- Install custom ROMs and kernels
- Enhance performance and battery life
- Access advanced features and settings
- Use apps that require root permissions

#### Will rooting void my warranty?
Generally yes, rooting voids your device warranty. However, it specifically depends upon your device manufacturer and region. Some manufacturers are more lenient and provide official methods to unlock the bootloader.

#### Can I unroot my device?
Yes. You can unroot by:
- Using the "Uninstall" option in [Magisk Manager](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)
- Flashing stock firmware via tools like [ODIN](https://www.samsungodin.com/) for Samsung devices or [Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) for others

### Safety & Security

#### Is rooting safe?
Rooting itself is generally safe when done correctly, but carries some risks:
- Potential for bricking your device if done incorrectly
- Security vulnerabilities if not properly managed
- System instability from incompatible modifications

#### How can I protect sensitive apps on a rooted device?
You can:
1. Use [DenyList](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/denynotify.html) to hide root from specific apps
2. Use [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases) for additional root hiding
3. Use [Hide My Applist](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/Hide-My-Applist)

#### Are OTA updates safe after rooting?
Applying over-the-air (OTA) updates on a rooted device can cause issues. It's recommended to:
- Use custom recovery to flash updates manually
- Wait for community reviews about new update and its effects on root environment

### Troubleshooting

#### What should I do if my device won't boot after rooting?
1. Boot into recovery mode
2. Wipe cache and Dalvik cache
3. Restore from a backup if available
4. Flash the stock firmware
5. Seek assistance on forums like XDA Developers or your device's Telegram group

#### How do I fix SafetyNet/Play Integrity issues?
Use a combination of:
- [Play Integrity Fix](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix)
- [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)'s DenyList
- [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases) module
- Keep Magisk and modules up to date

#### Why aren't root apps detecting root access?
Check if:
1. Magisk is properly installed and updated
2. Apps have been granted root permissions
3. Root hiding features aren't blocking legitimate apps
4. Verify root access with tools like [Root Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joeykrim.rootcheck)

### Advanced Topics

#### What is a custom recovery and why do I need it?
A custom recovery like [TWRP](https://twrp.me/) or [OrangeFox Recovery](https://orangefox.download/) allows you to:
- Install custom ROMs and kernels
- Create full backups
- Wipe and format device partitions
- Flash mods and custom packages

#### How do I install a custom ROM?
1. Unlock your device's bootloader
2. Install a custom recovery (e.g., TWRP)
3. Backup your current system
4. Wipe necessary partitions (Data, Cache, Dalvik)
5. Flash the custom ROM ZIP file via recovery
6. Flash GApps if required
7. Reboot and configure your new system

#### What are Magisk Modules?
Magisk Modules are installable modifications that run at the system level, allowing you to customize your device without altering system partitions. They can add functionality, tweak performance, and more.
